                <h2>Hi I'm Lukas and this is my website.
                    <br><br/>
                    I am an interdisciplinary professional based in Copenhagen. 
                    I am a person with a ton of curiosity and an appetite to learn, which has led me to explore 
                    many different subjects in my academic, professional and personal life. 
                    Academically, I have focused primarily in cultural studies and more general social sciences.
                    I have a bachelor's degree in International Affairs from Lafayette College in the United States and a master's degree
                    in Nationalism Studies from Central European University in Vienna, Austria.
                    <br><br/>
                    Complimenting my academic education, my interests go beyond social sciences. My natural curiosity and drive to explore 
                    has led me to subjects ranging from music to film analysis and visual design to technology and digitalization. 
                    What has been my most prominent focus area, especially over the past few years has been more technical subjects, 
                    such as programming and data analysis.
                    <br><br/> 
                    A few independent projects include building an 
                    application for storing generic client data and a dashboard displaying data from integrated environmental sensors in 
                    my home as a part of an Internet of Things (IoT) setup. This website which I have made from scratch using 
                    <a class="indexLink" href="https://pure-css.github.io/">Pure CSS</a> is another product of my interest in technology. I added some personal projects such as applications, visual art and other ideas and 
                    update them from time to time.
